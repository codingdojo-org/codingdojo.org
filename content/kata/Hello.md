    **About this Kata**

This is the famous " [\[Hello
World\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program) " program.
Hello World is perhaps the first Kata -- it predates even the term
"kata". But people have been doing Hello World as effectively a kata for
over thirty years. The seminal book [\[The C Programming
Language\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_%28book%29)
has created the tradition of making it the first program in any new
language, environment, or methodology. So it follows that the first kata
should be Hello World.

Good for teaching: Katas themselves, [TDD](/TestDrivenDevelopment) ,
MockObjects , ensuring the environment is set up correctly.

**Problem Description**

The first thing the computer wants to do is to greet the outside world,
the most basic form of interaction. The task is simple: print the phrase
"Hello, World!" on the display. As a Kata, Hello World should be
completed using TDD and whatever other methodology you normally use.
Mock objects should probably be used to stub out the user display.

This teaches the kata method in the simplest possible terms. It's also
useful for ensuring that the environment is correctly set up. Before a
dojo, the organizer could do Hello World, just to make sure computer,
compiler, and projector are set up correctly.

**Suggested Test Cases**

There's only one test case: get "Hello, World!" on whatever output.

**Comments from those who are working on this Kata**

(Comment from [RonRomero](/people/RonRomero) ) I solved this one using
the concept of just testing the engine, and making the UI a thin
(non-tested) veneer. The writeup is [\[on my
blog.\]](http://ziroby.wordpress.com/2010/04/18/tdd_hello_world) I'm
thinking I might want to try it again with mock objects.
