    Gothenburg Ruby User Group

This is a group of geeks who meet regularly in Gothenburg, Sweden. The
purpose of the group is really to learn and discuss Ruby, but we usually
run a dojo-like session every other meeting. For more information see
our wiki or mailing list, groups.google.com/group/grug
