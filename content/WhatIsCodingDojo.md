    Definition
----------

A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work
on a programming challenge. They are there to have fun and to engage in
[DeliberatePractice](/DeliberatePractice) in order to improve their
skills.

The [ParisDojo](/dojo/ParisDojo) focuses on coding in front of others,
most often something from scratch, in a very short amount of time (1 to
1.5 hours). They use various languages, various tools, various exercise
formats. They consider the outcome of an exercise successful when it is
completed within allocated time AND audience can repeat the exercise at
home by themselves.

Maybe the [CodingDojoPrinciples](/CodingDojoPrinciples) help to
understand what the [CodingDojo](/CodingDojo) is about.

Premises
--------

-   Acquiring coding skills should be a continuous process

Characteristics
---------------

-   Non-competitive, collaborative, fun environment
-   All skill levels are welcome
-   Safe to try new ideas

Requirements
------------

-   Meeting room with enough seats (typical attendance varies between 5
    and 20 ?)
-   At least one PC or laptop
-   A digital projector ('beamer')

Process
-------

-   [ParisDojo](/dojo/ParisDojo) version:
    -   2 minutes: decide on date for next session
    -   25-30 minutes: quick retrospective of the previous session; what
        went well, what was interesting, what was frustrating
    -   10 minutes: decide on a topic for this session
        (we call these first three items the "next, prev,
        this" protocol)
    -   40 minutes or so: code! [PreparedKata](/PreparedKata) or
        [RandoriKata](/RandoriKata) , see below
    -   5-10 minutes: mid-session break to discuss how things are going
    -   40 minutes: code some more

Types of Meeting
----------------

### [PreparedKata](/PreparedKata)

-   A presenter shows how to solve the challenge from scratch, using
    [TDD](/TestDrivenDevelopment) and [BabySteps](/BabySteps) .
-   Each step must make sense to everyone present for.
-   People should interrupt only if they don't understand what is
    going on.

### [RandoriKata](/RandoriKata)

-   The challenge is solved by the coding pair (driver and copilot).
-   Everyone present is invited to help.
-   Each pair has a small (5 or 7 minutes) timebox to advance, using
    [TDD](/TestDrivenDevelopment) and [BabySteps](/BabySteps) .
-   At the end of the timebox, the driver goes back to the audience, the
    copilot becomes driver and one of the audience step up to
    be copilot.
